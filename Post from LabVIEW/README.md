These files are intended to help people post data to a Quix cloud hosted HTTP API.



The `.vi` file is a basic starting point.



It should be opened with LabVIEW then the paths to the `main.py` file and the location of the Python executable should be updated.



Note that at the time of writing, LabVIEW supports up to Python version `3.12`.

Ensure that you have the correct version, otherwise this is unlikely to work.



For an overview of how to use this and how to setup Quix to work with these files watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/cl1dPDqQNoI).
